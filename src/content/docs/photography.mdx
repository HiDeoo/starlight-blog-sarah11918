My bird and nature photography hobby began in earnest with a Nikon P900 super-zoom camera. As I joined forums to learn how to use the camera and improve my photography, it turned out many of the users of this camera were using it for bird photography because of its long reach. So, that's what I learned how to do, and how my photography pivoted from travel journaling to nature.

I then upgraded to the Sony RX10iv for fast shutter speeds and burst modes (though less zoom) to better capture birds in flight. That camera is still today considered the best compact, non-interchangeable lens camera for birding and is popular among aging birders who "downsize" their gear. While fantastic in the field, 

On a whim, I wandered into my local pawn shop and discovered an inexpensive, old Nikon D7000 DSLR which I initially intended only for indoor/low-light photography (e.g. family gatherings, bowling tournaments). However, I noticed the improved image quality and the lack of start-up time with a DSLR compared to the RX10iv made it a compelling upgrade for nature photography, too. When my trusty local pawn shop had a compatible 70-300mm lens available, I finally had a chance to give the Nikon a serious try for birding and was hooked.

<p>I now use a Nikon D7500 and D500 for all my photography, and have since added a used Sigma 150-600mm which I was thrilled to find locally very inexpensively. On my photo walks, I usually wear a Cotton Carrier harness to distribute the weight of the camera and lens while also giving me quick access for spontaneous shots. I am still learning how to use (I mean, even how to **hold**!) the new gear, but I enjoy the challenge and occasional rewarding capture!</p>

## Albums

I'm still organizing photos on Flickr, and figuring out the best way to display my collections of photos.

In the mean time, you can [visit my Flickr photo stream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahrainsberger/) or see a sample embedded album below:
