I realized while working *on* this site that it's been a while since I've written *for* this site!

So, I'm hoping I can jump-start my writing by taking advantage of the delightful coincidence that I've got 50 days left until I'm 50 and motivate myself to write one, small, helpful or interesting tidbit per day.

I'll make a separate post for each one, and will share in a Fediverse thread on my Mastodon account but I'll come back to this one and update the list as we go.

Let's see if I can do it!

1. "... if one does not already exist." When instructing a reader to make a new file or folder, acknowledge that one might already exist.

2. When an instruction is conditional, put the condition *before* the action to perform.
